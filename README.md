# Next.js 15 useRouter.push Not Working

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where `useRouter.push` fails to redirect correctly.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` component uses `useRouter` to navigate back to the home page.  However, the button click does not trigger the redirection.  This issue occurs specifically in Next.js 15.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the "Go to Home" button.  Observe that redirection does not occur.

## Expected Behavior

Clicking the button should redirect the user to the `/` (home) route.

## Actual Behavior

The page does not redirect.  The URL remains `/about`.

## Solution

The solution involves using `router.replace` instead of `router.push`.  This change correctly navigates to the home page. See `aboutSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that your Next.js version is 15.x.x
- Check for any conflicting packages that may interfere with the router.
- Verify that your routes are correctly defined in `pages` directory.
